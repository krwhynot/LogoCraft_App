# PyQt6 Migration Testing Strategy

## Testing Hierarchy
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Individual widget functionality
   - Signal-slot mechanism verification
   - Event handling validation

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Complete workflow scenarios
   - Cross-widget interaction testing
   - State management verification

3. **System Testing**
   - Full application performance
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Resource utilization assessment

## Testing Tools
- pytest
