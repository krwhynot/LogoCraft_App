# PyQt6 Migration Project Requirements

## Prerequisite Setup
1. Python Version
   - Python 3.8+ recommended
   - Ensure compatibility with existing codebase

2. Required Dependencies
   ```
   PyQt6==6.5.0
   pyqt6-tools==6.5.0
   typing-extensions
   ```

3. Development Environment
   - Virtual environment isolation
   - IDE with PyQt6 support (PyCharm, VS Code)
   - Qt Designer for UI prototyping

4. Installation Commands
   ```bash
   python -m venv pyqt6_migration
   source pyqt6_migration/bin/activate  # Unix
   pyqt6_migration\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   
   pip install PyQt6 pyqt6-tools
   ```

## Compatibility Considerations
- Review type hints and type compatibility
- Assess signal-slot mechanism differences
- Evaluate cross-platform rendering consistency

## Migration Checklist
### Dependency Management
- [ ] Install PyQt6 via pip
- [ ] Review and update project requirements/dependencies

### Import Statements
- [ ] Replace Tkinter imports with PyQt6 imports
- [ ] Update all Tkinter-specific imports to PyQt6 equivalents

### Window and Widget Creation
- [ ] Replace `Tk()` with `QApplication` and `QMainWindow`
- [ ] Migrate widget creation from Tkinter to PyQt6 classes
- [ ] Reimplement layout management using `QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`

### Event Handling
- [ ] Replace `.bind()` with `.connect()` for signal-slot mechanisms
- [ ] Adapt event handling to PyQt6's signal-slot architecture
